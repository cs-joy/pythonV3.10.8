# variable: basically it's just container where we can store certain data values
#           and we use a variable put those data values inside containers, it makes a lot easier for us to
#           work with and manage all of the different data inside of our programs
# 
#           so, variables are extremely helpful and its like core topic in python, you really go want to know in Master

character_name = "Tom" # storing string
                       # a string is basically just plain text

character_age = "20"   # string
#character_age = 20    # numbers (decimal or any other types are included in python, i.e: 20.4387546)

# boolean
# so much important
is_Male = True # either True or False are valid in boolean data types

# so basic data types are:
#     - string
#     - numbers
#     - boolean

print("There onece was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old.")

character_name = "Joy" # updating the value of the variable
print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ", ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")
